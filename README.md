# Rest-API-with-RUST
Created a simple rest api with RUST and ROCKET.

This app uses API from http://api.openweathermap.org/ 
And saves data of a particular city locally in api.json
To tackle limited API calls. 
Will make it dynamic which will take City name from User and show it's weater

Sigin at openweathermap.org and add your API key on line 33 in src/main.rs
