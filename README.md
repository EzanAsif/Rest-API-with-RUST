# Rest API with RUST
Created a simple rest api with RUST and ROCKET.

This app uses API from http://api.openweathermap.org/ 
And saves data of a particular city locally in api.json
To tackle limited API calls. 
Will make it dynamic which will take City name from User and show it's weather

Sigin at openweathermap.org, get your API key and add your API key on line 33 in src/main.rs after &appid
And then cargo run to run the app but make sure rust nightly is installed on your PC
